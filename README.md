# python_intensive_t1

Well, I started by trying to get a web-based doodle jump clone which turned up bugs that I couldn't find a solution for.
So I started on something that I had kinda been considering for a few weeks, understanding that it would satisfy the new requirements,
I began on my journey. This would be a python note taking app that could support multiple users with seperate logins
and a graphical user interface.
